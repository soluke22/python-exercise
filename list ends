#Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

import random
a = random.sample(range(1, 100), 10)
def list_ends(a):
    return [a[0], a[len(a)-1]]
